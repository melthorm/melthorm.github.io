Qg3 Kh7 { Definitely a mistake, I thought after Bf6 I would go Bf2 and keep on trying to attack, but there's probably no attack anymore } 17. e5 Bh6 18. Nf4 Rg8 19. Bc1 { Huge mistake by me, I did this because I was afraid in some variations, allowing him to take my bishop with a check would be very bad, but honestly, I didn't have anything concrete. Should've just brought my a rook in though } (19. Rae1) 19... Bxf4 20. Bxf4 (20. Qxf4 Rg7 21. Qh6+ Kg8 22. Bg5 Qf8 23. Bf6 Rh7 24. Qg5 { I did not think this was that winning.
