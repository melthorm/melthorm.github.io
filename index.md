# If the world was ending ...

HEY! It's a good song, ok, trust... Anyways, I'm `Ben` (it says Benjamin up there but I go by Ben). Uh, I'm an incoming freshman at UT Austin for Computer Science though I probably won't update this so I'll most likely be a freshman when you're reading this. 

I chose Computer Science because I really love math (`nerd`) and because I like being able to make something that I imagine into something real and tangible through programming. I mean, so many different fields with a lot of math are available for exploration via code which is very fun! 

A few examples that I've worked stuffs on before and/or currently are `phylogenetics` (like evolutionary history), `phage engineering` (like core genes), and `signal acquisition` (like weird math complex numbers). Idk, for me personally, I believe CS is the best discipline for learning about different fields. If, for some apparent reason (unless you're a recruiter or something) you'd like to see my resume or _curriculum vitae_, click [here](/cv/).

# Some stuff about me

I really like chess. I really like piano. I really like creative writing. Yep, oh, and the programming stuff, ig. Most of the posts here will probably either be about those four things (or it'll be me `crashing out` for some stupid reason of which there are many).

# Some cool stuff that I did at some point (+ my old personal site which for some reason people think is ugly)
