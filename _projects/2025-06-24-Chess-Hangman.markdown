This is `Chess Hangman`, a training thing I made for my chess students to help with `visualization` (mostly helping myself + it's also fun). Basically, you try to guess where the chess pieces are in a puzzle. You're given the puzzle solution, and a set number of guesses!

`There's a lot that can be improved. Firstly, rather than needing to get all the pieces right to win, it'd perhaps be better to simply require, say, 50 % of pieces correct to win (I say this because multiple NMs cannot solve these problems (nor can I)). Also, the zoom is rather scuffed.`
