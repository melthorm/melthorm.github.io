I never got into `Notion` or `Google Calendar`. I don't know why, but I'm paranoid about them having data. It's pretty bad. Oh well.

Like `2` years ago(?), I made a task list thingy that helps me keep track of tasks I have to do. I outfitted it with some cool keybindings and just used it to bring myself dopamine whenever completing a task like homework or practice. It's written pretty scuffed, and it interfaces with my setup using conky (which I think Windows also has), but like it's cool.

That was the first thing that's listed below. The second thing that's listed is a calendar I made using curses that's pretty recent. It has a couple cool keybindings and I had ChatGPT write a README so it should actually have good documentation. The first one has no documentation, and I also do not quite want to revisit the code.
