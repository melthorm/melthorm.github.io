I mean, that definition is rather relative, but for me, I think I’ve gone about a full year without a truly successful tournament. I’ve had tournaments where I haven’t been completely droven into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ground</code>, but I haven’t had any for at least a year where I’ve felt confident (and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good</code>) at chess. The last tournament where I had success was the 2024 Universal Chess Open U2000<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(?)</code> where I got 2nd place (+ a lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">money</code>!). Hans Niemann played at that tournament. I saw him. It was quite the experience.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The fact that I am <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alive</code> at this moment is a miracle, because after this first game I was ready to go the ocean and never come back!</p>

  <p>I wanted to lose as quickly as possible, so I could go back to my hotel room, turn the lights off, order some delivery, watch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Netflix and numb the pain</code> until the next game. I think my Uber Eats has gone up to 1000 dollars for this event. I have been indulging and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">numbing the pain</code> with 1000 dollar Uber Eats.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Quote by one <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hans Niemann</code> (most chess player quote I’ve ever seen)</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Either way, the point I wanted to make was that I was on some level of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tilt</code> for chess. I mean, I’ve never practiced or studied in any full capacity for chess, instead just kinda playing for fun, but it certainly does not feel good to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lose</code>. Actually, for like a month before this tournament, I was engaging in a lot of chess: playing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rapid</code> games, analyzing, and doing tons of chess <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puzzles</code>. For me, chess is kinda a way to feel productive while waiting for something to happen or when I’m nervous. Idk. I played some chess right before graduation for some reasons. And I will leave it at that. Anyways, this was a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">four game, one day</code> tournament (so pretty short in comparison to the three day or two day seven round tournaments).</p>

<p>I came into the first game realizing that I was playing against somebody who coached me for, I think, two weeks when I just got back into chess and was maybe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1100 USCF</code>. I was underrated though.</p>

<p>A rather sad game. Definitely could’ve been played better by me. The sad part is just how close I was to a perfect game. Move 24 (g4) is a huge mistake. Like, Jesus, just play Kh2. For some reason, I was in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attack-attack-attack</code> mindset, so I ignored common sense. The craziest part is that I saw his ideas with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Qd5</code> and pinning my queen with his rook, but for some reason, I thought – looks pretty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cool</code>, down to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">try</code>.</p>

<p>I wanted to talk to my opponent after but, at the same time, felt kind of bad, so I did not do anything (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pro</code> extrovert).</p>

<p>Uh, quite a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sad</code> game. I think I was still somewhat on tilt the first two games. I played really poorly this game. Some absolutely abysmal follow ups to sacrifices and just no drive to fight for counterplay. Move 15 (a3) could’ve been replaced with d5 and I would’ve been <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ding chilling</code>. Surprisingly, I still feel really great about this tournament even though I lost this game. I also think that’s because my opponent was rated so far above me (2200 USCF) to the point where, even though I think I could’ve put up a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">much better</code> fight, it’s fine that I didn’t.</p>

<p>I also talked to this guy after the game. It was very fun talking to him. He’s also like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CS adjacent</code> but at, I think, CMU (pretty smart guy). It’s kinda sad to think how <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">difficult</code> chess will be to maintain in college though. Hopefully, I actually start practicing and studying to get better!</p>

<p>I’m just now realizing that by posting chess to my website, my opponents that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prep</code> are going to have a much easier time. Welp, hopefully I can just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outskill</code> them. Actually, the better idea might be getting so good at chess that I can play <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">any opening</code>! Yeah, that’s not happening. I’m pretty washed and bad at chess.</p>

<p>This game was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decent</code> by me. Yeah, there were quite a few mistakes, but is what it is. I need to practice more chess. The opening was entirely new territory for me, but I should’ve just stuck to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sicilian Khan</code> setup. Immediately after playing Move 6 (Qb6), I realized a6 was so much <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">better</code>. a6 is a move in the Khan setup, should’ve just followed the limited opening theory I know.</p>

<p>Also, you have no idea how tempted I was to take on f2 with my Queen on Move 7. Yes, it’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">completely losing</code>. But…idk man, looks cool or something? Still can’t believe I missed the complexities in Bc5. I spent a long time looking at that move. But for some reason, I never fully explored Ne3.</p>

<p>I’m very happy, obviously — as happy as you can be beating a little kid.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s funnier when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Magnus</code> says it. Very nice game though. I liked my tactical prowess here. Also, I liked that one of my coach’s ideas (a5) actually worked. I’d been telling him that a5 looked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stupid</code> (because it does) but it actually worked. Crazy. Some very nice Knight <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jumps</code>, and I calculated basically to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">end</code> from Move 11.</p>

<p>I do feel bad about this game though. I am very sad and often tilt after losing chess games in that kinda way so I do hope my opponent gets over it quick.</p>

<hr />
<p>End Results</p>

<p><img src="/assets/postImages/MyBestTournamentYet1.png" alt="asdf" title="DD" /></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Very bad tiebreaks</code></p>

<p>I am quite satisfied with my performance. Tournament was played on 6/21/2025. I also grew 100 USCF points which is pretty damn good for just one tournament. Here is the lichess <a href="https://lichess.org/study/zMyqTta6/lbKKtqQy">study</a> if you wanted to see it.</p>

<hr />

<p>I unfortunately did not take any photos at this tournament. I feel like I am regretting more and more when I don’t take <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">photos</code> at places in general. Perhaps part of getting older. Idk. I talked to a lot of cool people this tournament. Actually, that’s a strange pattern for tournaments where I’m <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">successful</code>. Another strange pattern is succeeding at tournaments when I’m also getting over something in my life. Wait, that’s actually true. That’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crazy</code>. This was a much shorter tournament than the 2024 Universal Open U2000, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patterns</code> are still the same. I’m also not sure if it’s talking to other tournament players that makes me win games or if it’s me winning games that makes me want to talk to other tournament players. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strange</code>.</p>

<p>Anyways, as is tradition, I will leave you with a nice little chess position.</p>

Either way, I think I most felt that way due to the stress of the summer right before that. The simplest way to illustrate this is in the schedule I had during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">July</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I very much want to preface, though, by saying that, even though that summer was extremely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stressful</code>, I also would not have changed anything. 
I learned and developed so many skills that I very much value now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, during the weekdays on July, I had an internship that had me wake up at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7:30 AM</code> (frankly, not all that early considering when school starts) and getting home at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5:30 PM</code>. Don’t get me wrong – I am invariably grateful for the opportunities and learning experiences I had during that internship, but it was also the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full</code> 9-5 (though really an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8-5</code>) that I’d worked with real responsibilities. Plus, I also did a lot of work on internship projects at home, which looking back (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hindsight bias</code>), was probably a major stressor. On Saturday, I’d wake up at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6:00 AM</code> and volunteer at St. David’s Hospital until <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3:00 PM</code>. Again, I want to make myself clear, these experiences were fantastic – the people I met and the activities I partook(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>) in were great! However, at the same time, it was the most <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filled up</code> my schedule had ever been (beyond school, which, at a certain point, stops being stressful). After <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3:00 PM</code>, I’d teach and manage a small chess club a friend and I started until about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5:00 PM</code> (again, the most fun I’ve perhaps had in a long time, but still very much the longest I’ve ever had to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on</code>).</p>

<p>As I’m writing this, I’m realizing that perhaps it’s not very interesting for me to explain why each of these events were great while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concurrently</code> ‘complaining’ about the stress they caused, but that was the reality I had. Between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7:00 PM</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8:30</code> PM, I’d teach a private chess class. Sunday was a lot of chess. We had a chess club meeting some days as well as the afternoon consisting of chess classes. That being said, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sunday</code> was the most relaxing day within those weeks. It would be the day I’d be waiting for – mainly because I knew I’d have time to practice piano, read, and review the (very fun!) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> that I was learning about at my internship.</p>

<p>I tried to sprinkle those things in between the other times I had, but frankly, most days, I was way too tired to do anything other than just watch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YouTube</code>, or at best, go down some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wikipedia rabbit hole</code>. Some weekends, I’d also go to competitions or tournaments as well, which was very interesting to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fit in</code>.</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I'm not one to really take pictures (kinda a regret now, my friend took some photos with me here), but I never really did</code></p>

<p>Quite the stressful time looking back. But also, I kinda don’t get how I was so stressed. Like, honestly, just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keep your head down and work like K does</code>. That was not as funny as I thought it would be!</p>

<p>I mean, looking back, I gained a lot from being so stressed during summer. In fact, I think I probably could’ve grown more by being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code> stressed! The fact is that…what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger…I’m sorry. No, but it’s also kind of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>! I think, being forced to pursue all those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code> things, have such <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">little</code> free time, and also get a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full</code> 8 hours each night (which I force myself to do), plus maintain my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prior</code> skills, develops something that can’t be given by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetics</code> or even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard work</code>.</p>

<p>I think a lot of life is based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">luck</code>, not talent or hard work. Surprisingly, who you’re friends with is oftentimes just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chance</code>. I think I got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lucky</code> getting this experience right before senior year.</p>

<p>So much was learned. Mostly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>, but also some other stuff. Yeah, I’m kinda running out of things to say. I somehow found time to do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">activities</code> with friends like climbing and going to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">places</code> (I do not know how).

It was undoubtedly somehow the most relaxed period of my high school career, and yet also simultaneously the most productive<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(?)</code> I’d felt yet. I hadn’t really decided that strongly what I wanted to study in college coming into senior year, so it was a bit of a rush watching everybody around me talk about college applications that first week back. I’d been considering computer science as a major, but frankly, I wasn’t much set on it.</p>

<p>Looking back, the main reason I was considering computer science was pretty stupid (most of my friends who already graduated went into it), but it was still the main factor nonetheless. Also, after thinking about it, the college that I would most likely be attending due to cost, location, and relative prestige, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UT Austin</code>, was most well-renowned for computer science. So, I decided pretty quickly that I would be applying for computer science.</p>

<p>Of course, that came with a whole host of other issues. Computer science is notoriously competitive, which was certainly not very fun to think about. I’d been fortunate enough to be in the top 6% of my graduating class (which guarantees a spot at UT Austin), but everybody around me had been mentioning how that didn’t actually guarantee a major (ie. I would be admitted to UT Austin, but not to computer science). Either way, I wanted to try to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">boost</code> up my resume as much as I could before submitting college applications. I’d done some computer science stuff before, but honestly, it was nowhere near what other people had done. So, for those couple weeks before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">October</code> (which was when UT Austin’s deadline was), I embarked on a lot of different projects to, perhaps unhealthily, grow my resume. Don’t get me wrong – the process of learning about all those different fields and thinking programmatically was extremely rewarding and probably useful, but I still think that the primary cause of why I did all that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(resume projects)</code> was not good.</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Yeah, I had this turned on always for some reason</code></p>

<p>Either way, eventually, I saw a really cool personal site (forgot whose tho) and, pretty flippantly, decided that I wanted something similar. So, I spent a weekend (with a lot of help from certain AI tools) building the html and css for the old site. The one painful part after I’d finished was writing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog posts</code> (I’d heard of like Jekyll and stuff, but frankly, I didn’t think I was knowledgable enough in computer science to understand how those site generators worked). I’d learned <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bash</code> the summer before senior year from an internship (great experience) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">daily driving Linux</code> (I’m a nerd, shut up), and I’d been writing some useful scripts + productivity stuff for my own Linux setup so I decided to take a stab at probably the most impressive part of the entire old site: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the blog post generator</code>.</p>

<p>In hindsight, the code and actual generation is done really poorly. I mean, there’s no image support, and I have to manually type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;br&gt;</code> for a new line (not good), but it worked for my setup (which was very poor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">center-aligned</code> blog posts, nothing like what I have now, which are very poor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">left-aligned</code> blog posts). I think, at that point in time, I was just so captured by all the little things that programming could replace, so even something as trivial as a .txt reader was fascinating. The idea that I could navigate to a blogPosts directory, write a .txt file, run a script, and then have a .html file corresponding to a blog post now on the site, was really damn cool.</p>
