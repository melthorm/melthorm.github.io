    <p class="lead">Summer before Senior Year</p>

    <p>In my last post, I started off with saying that spring semester of senior year was simultaneously the most <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">relaxing</code> time and the most <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">productive</code> time of my year (reading that in my head, I now realize that those are not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mutually exclusive</code>). Either way, I think I most felt that way due to the stress of the summer right before that. The simplest way to illustrate this is in the schedule I had during <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">July</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I very much want to preface, though, by saying that, even though that summer was extremely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stressful</code>, I also would not have changed anything. 
I learned and developed so many skills that I very much value now.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, during the weekdays on July, I had an internship that had me wake up at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7:30 AM</code> (frankly, not all that early considering when school starts) and getting home at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5:30 PM</code>. Don’t get me wrong – I am invariably grateful for the opportunities and learning experiences I had during that internship, but it was also the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full</code> 9-5 (though really an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8-5</code>) that I’d worked with real responsibilities. Plus, I also did a lot of work on internship projects at home, which looking back (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hindsight bias</code>), was probably a major stressor. On Saturday, I’d wake up at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">6:00 AM</code> and volunteer at St. David’s Hospital until <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3:00 PM</code>. Again, I want to make myself clear, these experiences were fantastic – the people I met and the activities I partook(<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>) in were great! However, at the same time, it was the most <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filled up</code> my schedule had ever been (beyond school, which, at a certain point, stops being stressful). After <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3:00 PM</code>, I’d teach and manage a small chess club a friend and I started until about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">5:00 PM</code> (again, the most fun I’ve perhaps had in a long time, but still very much the longest I’ve ever had to be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on</code>).</p>

<p>As I’m writing this, I’m realizing that perhaps it’s not very interesting for me to explain why each of these events were great while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">concurrently</code> ‘complaining’ about the stress they caused, but that was the reality I had. Between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">7:00 PM</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">8:30</code> PM, I’d teach a private chess class. Sunday was a lot of chess. We had a chess club meeting some days as well as the afternoon consisting of chess classes. That being said, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Sunday</code> was the most relaxing day within those weeks. It would be the day I’d be waiting for – mainly because I knew I’d have time to practice piano, read, and review the (very fun!) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> that I was learning about at my internship.</p>

<p>I tried to sprinkle those things in between the other times I had, but frankly, most days, I was way too tired to do anything other than just watch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YouTube</code>, or at best, go down some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Wikipedia rabbit hole</code>. Some weekends, I’d also go to competitions or tournaments as well, which was very interesting to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fit in</code>.</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I'm not one to really take pictures (kinda a regret now, my friend took some photos with me here), but I never really did</code></p>

<p>Quite the stressful time looking back. But also, I kinda don’t get how I was so stressed. Like, honestly, just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">keep your head down and work like K does</code>. That was not as funny as I thought it would be!</p>

<p>I mean, looking back, I gained a lot from being so stressed during summer. In fact, I think I probably could’ve grown more by being <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code> stressed! The fact is that…what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger…I’m sorry. No, but it’s also kind of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>! I think, being forced to pursue all those <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">different</code> things, have such <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">little</code> free time, and also get a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">full</code> 8 hours each night (which I force myself to do), plus maintain my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prior</code> skills, develops something that can’t be given by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">genetics</code> or even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard work</code>.</p>

<p>I think a lot of life is based on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">luck</code>, not talent or hard work. Surprisingly, who you’re friends with is oftentimes just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chance</code>. I think I got <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lucky</code> getting this experience right before senior year.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/postImages/StressfulSummer1.png" alt="gc" title="Google Calendar" />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">I don't really use calendars (for some reason, I think I'll get a better memory by just memorizing what I have to do)</code></p>

<p>So much was learned. Mostly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">R</code>, but also some other stuff. Yeah, I’m kinda running out of things to say. I somehow found time to do <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">activities</code> with friends like climbing and going to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">places</code> (I do not know how). Anyways, I will leave you guys with a very nice chess position (plus, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main@benjamincai.com</code> works as an email now! (cloudflare was surprisingly easy, 17 year old me was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stupid</code>, nothing like 18 year old me who is very <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">smart</code>)).</p>
