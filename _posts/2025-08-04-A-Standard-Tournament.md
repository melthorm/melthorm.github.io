Yoooo. Uh, mb bro. Might've neglected to post. Oh well. I'm still better than those people who take a year to post!

I know I've quoted this before, but it's actually a fire quote! Oh wait, wrong one. You see, I just copy pasted the old tournament `.md` file, but I did want to talk about a cool quote...

Fire quote.

I did pretty bad at this tournament. But honestly, I feel pretty great. That might be because this tournament happened like a month ago, but it might also just be because I `literally don't care`. Nah...nvm, doesn't really work. Sometimes works when Hikaru does it though.

Uh, first game was pretty not perfect. Mainly because I somehow messed up a really nice attack. Oh well. I am kind of a professional fumbler. Actually... I think I fumbled all my games. Very sad.

Yeah, I kinda suck. I played this game a month ago. I still regret it. At least, I scammed out a draw... Professional fumbler Benjamin Cai. 

Also, my friend said it's probably not good that I put people's names here, and he's probably right. So, no more names. I'm too lazy to remove the old ones though. If I ever become famous I will though. No `free` clout.

A true Benjamin Cai moment. I suck at chess. Oh well. Will probably be fine. Talked with the guy after. He was pretty chill. He was not as young as me though. But he was very chill. Not much to say about the game other than I hard threw. I don't even know how me and my opponent analyzed. Like what is there to analyze? I just lost horrendously.

Yeah, this one hurt cause I was kinda cooking. Computer says draw but like any human is gonna wanna play as black. Oh well. Is what it is.

So, this is the start of the games that I stopped having good notation for. The other three games I put in as soon as I finished playing. So those have pretty good comments tbh. Oh shoot, I haven't done a `red` thing. `mb`, `mb`. 

Anyways, uh, reading my handwriting was quite fun. Sometimes, when I notate chess games while playing, I forget to write a move so then I get like messed up and I write one move as two so that I reset back to the correct white and black. Like, yk, how chess notation switches between white and black. So if you miss one move, you're `offset`. I'll write two moves to correct that. Problem is sometimes, if my handwriting is really bad, that gets confusing. Yeah, I could not read my own handwriting. I'm `cracked`!

Fine game, though, like always, I fumbled. They should honestly just call me the fumbler. Idk, good thought man. I scammed a win like how I scammed a draw that first game.

Not much to say. Very, very boring game. Literally nothing to analyze. Couple `sacs` that were possible throughout but my opponent and I both missed them, so is what it is. Draw is better than a loss... though the difference between a win and a draw is infinitely greater than the difference between a draw and a loss. Man, it really just is what it is.

End Results

I did `2/5`, so uh, really bad. But uh, it's fine. Probably the last chess tournament I go to in a long time if I'm being realistic. But like, there's still hope for `gm` yk. Nah, not really. I'm too bad at chess. I don't even think there's hope for `2000` anymore. Is what it is though.

Uh, no photos. Not much to say there. Every time I go to a tournament, I feel very alone. Oh well, is what it is. Hans Niemann does the thing where he streams about how lonely he is. That's why he's my goat. Not like sad alone though. I'm like happy alone yk. I don't know.
