<p>Hey, I don’t know if anybody reads this thing. I have not tracked analytics in weeks. Oh well. I like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">talking</code> or whatever this functions as. I wouldn’t call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writing</code> since it’s not really as purposeful as I’d like, but it’s also clearly not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">talking</code>. Idk.</p>

<p>Point is, I kinda like just sitting down and putting the stuff I’ve been thinking about down (down used twice there sounds weird). After all, if you yourself won’t like listening to your thoughts, who else will?</p>

<p>Think of this as just a description of what’s been going on and how I’ve been adjusting to college.</p>

<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEP, I may have thrown</code></p>

<p>So uh, worst part is, I don’t even think the content was that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hard</code>. It’s just, I mean, I don’t want to use it as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">excuse</code>, but like I was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deathly</code> sick while taking the exam. I came in with a facemask because breathing in normal air hurt. My eyes were burning the entire time. My head was on fire (not in a good way). It was pretty bad. Still though, rather disappointing that I performed so well. I’d expect myself to still perform better even under worse circumstances.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">68</code> is pretty bad. But the bright side is that it is very much recoverable. I’ve looked down on those who cling to something impossible so fiercely in the past, but like, in this case, it is very much not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impossible</code>. Professor, who is a very good lecturer and cool guy, grades on a z score so my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">68</code> actually becomes a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B</code>. That’s still pretty bad, but like, if I drop outlier z scores on the next couple exams, I should be fine. I’ll just make sure to study and hopefully not get sick. I’m not looking forward to the Spring when my allergies kick in again. I hate allergies. My number one opp.</p>

<p>The most scary thing is that, I think, even if I was at a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not-sick</code> performance level, I still wouldn’t have dropped higher than a 90. There were actual, real mistakes that I made. One example, is that I didn’t know that tree diagrams branches might need the given for a probability depending on the situation when drawing them. I mean, I still get to the right answer, but if asked to draw a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree diagram</code>, that is a mistake. Everything else – I think – would’ve been correct had I no been a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dead man</code> walking while taking the exam.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/postImages/Life1_21.jpeg" alt="stsdfs" title="c" />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fun</code></p>

<p>On the topic of content though, I love <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">probability</code>. I mean, the content is just very interesting. I don’t really know how else to put it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-kinda-bright-side">The kinda Bright Side</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/postImages/Life1_3.jpeg" alt="stsdfs" title="light" />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kinda light</code></p>

<p>Most classes are actually a lot easier than I expected. I mean, I did drop a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">68</code>, but like…yeah no, I kinda just failed the test. Oh well. Hopefully, it works out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fine</code>.</p>

<p>Uh, data structures is fine. The test was better than I thought. Probability is somewhat fine. Oh, my schedule. It’s, uh, probability, discrete, data structures, vector calc, and a first year signature course. Discrete and vector calc have literally only been <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">review</code> of high school classes so it’s kinda hard for me to comment on difficulty. Yeah. Still better than high school because we move faster though.</p>

<p>I <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">surprisingly</code> think I have more free time in college than high school. That’s crazy to think about. Probably most of it comes from having less class time, but like, the homework is also less. Crazy. If I get less than an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> in probability though, you guys can all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">laugh</code> at me. I mean, that will be entirely my fault and my pride will be pretty <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funny</code> to look at. I hope, if that happens, I temper my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pride</code>, become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">humble</code>, and accept the mistake in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ego</code>.</p>

<h2 id="people">people</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/postImages/Life1_4.png" alt="stsdfs" title="people" />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interesting people</code></p>

<p>The people here are… <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interesting</code>. I don’t know. What I like is that I don’t feel a need to talk to random people. I mean, I sometimes do, but like it feels fine to just do stuff <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alone</code>. In high school, that was kinda different. Doing stuff alone just felt lonely. In college though, it’s just like, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ok cool</code>.</p>

<p>Also, it’s been insanely hard to keep some friend groups from high school alive. Like genuinely impossible <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tough</code>. Like to the point where I’m down to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">give up</code>.</p>

<p>The college people I’ve met have been cool and chill though. Nothing much to say there.</p>

<h2 id="piano-chess-and-writing">Piano, Chess, and Writing</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/postImages/Life1_5.png" alt="stsdfs" title="offf, oh i mean t ooooof" />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sad no more practice</code></p>

<p>I believe I’ve wrote about this before, but I really like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">piano</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chess</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">writing</code>. However, surprisingly, I’ve found it rather hard to keep those hobbies alive. I mean, I go to the chess club (it’s like sectioned off in a mall and feels extremely <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sketch</code>, but the people are cool), but I haven’t really <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enjoyed</code> chess to the same extent I used to. Idk, it’s weird. I liked OTB tournaments quite a lot (I’ve gone to two since coming to UT), and if anything, that’s become more true. While I never really liked online chess, I would still find enjoyment in it and play to get better. However, I’ve found that instead of doing a chess puzzle when I have some downtime in a class or on a walk, I just read <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apple News</code>. It is very sad. I’m old now. Wtf. Might be time to pass the torch on. That’s sad.</p>

<p>I came into UT Austin wanting to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">double major</code> in Piano. After seeing the Interactive Degree Audit (showing me the needed classes), and realizing that about 0 classes overlap, piano requires 8 semesters of ensemble (I have 0 right now), and there are about 60 hours of theory classes, I have given up. I mean, I think the classes are possible in some <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alternate</code> world, but the 8 semesters of ensemble already means I’d be graduating a semester <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">late</code>. I came into college wanting to graduate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">early</code>. 
I’ve also finally found a good piano. I used to take the long walk to the Butler Hall of Music (which is about a 20 minute endeavor in 90 degree weather), but now I’ve discovered a Grand Piano right in the lobby of my dorm. I probably should’ve used that earlier. I’m smart. It’s kinda a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scuffed</code> piano, but like it’s also good. I sincerely want to make sure that I can perform the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4 Ballades</code> well. In my opinion, the 4 Ballades are the pinnacle of Chopin’s writing (actually maybe not, but they’re the best series), so I think being able to perform all 4 in one go would be really, really <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cool</code>. Yep, just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cool</code>.</p>

<p>As for writing, it’s always been kind of on and off, and I’ve had trouble sticking to a stable, daily regiment. At the same time though, I’ve always maintained some kind of practice. Though, for some reason, I’ve just had a hard time keeping that up in college. Luckily, there’s a cool <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LLC</code> (which is like kind of an org) that’s about writing which does weekly things. That means, at the very least, I can somewhat keep up weekly stories of some sort.</p>

<p>The most surprising thing for me is that each of these three hobbies have not even dropped off in output due to less time. No, strangely, it’s not that. I can’t actually seem to pinpoint the exact reason, but my belief is that it’s something to do with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">environment</code>. I’ve long held the belief that environment dictates a lot of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">routine</code>, so perhaps, by moving to the dorm room as my main home instead of say my computer desk at home (I know very <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sad</code> main home for both), I’ve lost some routine that kept up my hobbies. Rather interesting.</p>

<h2 id="some-ending-thoughts-as-a-time-capsule">Some ending thoughts as a time capsule</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/postImages/Life1_6.png" alt="stsdfs" title="time capsule" />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">trust me, when i'm 89 on my deathbed, imma look at ts</code></p>

<p>This stuff will be more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all-over-the-place</code> than anything else.</p>

<p>Firstly, I think I came in wanting to do too many things. I got rejected from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Longhorn Developers</code> (like a UT organization for developing stuff), but at the same time, I’m not sure how fun nor how much time I’d be willing to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commit</code> to that. I have so many things I want to get good at – like CAD, 3d printing stuff, robotics, math, proofs, business – and at the end of the day, I think I’m very <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stretched out</code>. This is also me just not wanting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sour</code> grapes though (if you know that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allegory</code>).</p>

<p>I have some serious <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">math</code> commitments as part of a Directed Reading Program which has been very fun (mainly due to my great <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mentor</code>). I also have some robotics stuff I want to do (and that I owe my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Combat Robotics</code> team to do). And then, I also just have this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subdueing</code> desire to start some business. Idk why though. Yeah, I’ve been kinda down from getting rejected from LHD. Perhaps, that was my mistake for only applying to a few <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">orgs</code>. Some other people I’ve talked to have told me that they applied to over <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20</code>, and then I just think “wow, that’s crazy”.</p>

<p>Career fair was fun. I only handed out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4</code> resumes though. Everybody else handed out like 20. The people I talked to there were all super cool and nice (plus our conversations were fun). My lexicon has been gradually diminishing in complexity. Disappointing.</p>

<p>Also, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ChatGPT</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> is something that I never go that deep into. I only really used it with friends. Recently though, I've found that it's very good at explaining certain concepts. I treat it as like a </code>TA` that can explain a mathematical proof or a simpler form of Google for documentation. Like, you can ask it to explain what a Hessian matrix represents or whether a Java data structure has a .contains method.</p>

<p>I still waste too much time on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YouTube</code>. I have so many personal projects I also want to do. I’m stretched in too many directions. But like, at the same time, that’s what I like!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="to-conclude-i-will-conclude-by-saying-that-in-conclusion">To conclude, I will conclude, by saying that in conclusion…</h2>

<p>Shoot, I normally end these on a depressing note. Alright, I got this. I know how to end this on a depressing note.</p>

<p>I was thinking about the people I talked to in high school and realized that I will never see any of them who didn’t go to UT Austin again. That’s pretty depressing.</p>

<p>There are also one friend I have that’s out of state who I used to talk with a lot online (mainly talked in person before). Now, we’ve kinda stopped too.</p>

<p>Man, friendships suck. Too much <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">feeling</code>. I don’t quite like it. But like, at the same time, it’s gratifying to talk to people. Maybe, I just start talking to random people and use that to get my need for social interaction. There’s no commitment that way.</p>
