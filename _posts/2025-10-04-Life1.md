Hey, I don't know if anybody reads this thing. I have not tracked analytics in weeks. Oh well. I like `talking` or whatever this functions as. I wouldn't call it `writing` since it's not really as purposeful as I'd like, but it's also clearly not `talking`. Idk. 

Point is, I kinda like just sitting down and putting the stuff I've been thinking about down (down used twice there sounds weird). After all, if you yourself won't like listening to your thoughts, who else will?

Think of this as just a description of what's been going on and how I've been adjusting to college.

## the bad
![stsdfs](/assets/postImages/Life1_2.jpeg "The very very bad")
`YEP, I may have thrown`

So uh, worst part is, I don't even think the content was that `hard`. It's just, I mean, I don't want to use it as an `excuse`, but like I was `deathly` sick while taking the exam. I came in with a facemask because breathing in normal air hurt. My eyes were burning the entire time. My head was on fire (not in a good way). It was pretty bad. Still though, rather disappointing that I performed so well. I'd expect myself to still perform better even under worse circumstances.

The `68` is pretty bad. But the bright side is that it is very much recoverable. I've looked down on those who cling to something impossible so fiercely in the past, but like, in this case, it is very much not `impossible`. Professor, who is a very good lecturer and cool guy, grades on a z score so my `68` actually becomes a `B`. That's still pretty bad, but like, if I drop outlier z scores on the next couple exams, I should be fine. I'll just make sure to study and hopefully not get sick. I'm not looking forward to the Spring when my allergies kick in again. I hate allergies. My number one opp.

The most scary thing is that, I think, even if I was at a `not-sick` performance level, I still wouldn't have dropped higher than a 90. There were actual, real mistakes that I made. One example, is that I didn't know that tree diagrams branches might need the given for a probability depending on the situation when drawing them. I mean, I still get to the right answer, but if asked to draw a `tree diagram`, that is a mistake. Everything else -- I think -- would've been correct had I no been a `dead man` walking while taking the exam.

`fun`

On the topic of content though, I love `probability`. I mean, the content is just very interesting. I don't really know how else to put it.

## The kinda Bright Side
![stsdfs](/assets/postImages/Life1_3.jpeg "light")
`kinda light`

Most classes are actually a lot easier than I expected. I mean, I did drop a `68`, but like...yeah no, I kinda just failed the test. Oh well. Hopefully, it works out `fine`. 

Uh, data structures is fine. The test was better than I thought. Probability is somewhat fine. Oh, my schedule. It's, uh, probability, discrete, data structures, vector calc, and a first year signature course. Discrete and vector calc have literally only been `review` of high school classes so it's kinda hard for me to comment on difficulty. Yeah. Still better than high school because we move faster though.

I `surprisingly` think I have more free time in college than high school. That's crazy to think about. Probably most of it comes from having less class time, but like, the homework is also less. Crazy. If I get less than an `A` in probability though, you guys can all `laugh` at me. I mean, that will be entirely my fault and my pride will be pretty `funny` to look at. I hope, if that happens, I temper my `pride`, become `humble`, and accept the mistake in `ego`.

## people
![stsdfs](/assets/postImages/Life1_4.png "people")
`interesting people`

The people here are... `interesting`. I don't know. What I like is that I don't feel a need to talk to random people. I mean, I sometimes do, but like it feels fine to just do stuff `alone`. In high school, that was kinda different. Doing stuff alone just felt lonely. In college though, it's just like, `ok cool`. 

Also, it's been insanely hard to keep some friend groups from high school alive. Like genuinely impossible `tough`. Like to the point where I'm down to `give up`.

The college people I've met have been cool and chill though. Nothing much to say there.

## Piano, Chess, and Writing
![stsdfs](/assets/postImages/Life1_5.png "offf, oh i mean t ooooof")
`sad no more practice`

I believe I've wrote about this before, but I really like `piano` and `chess` and `writing`. However, surprisingly, I've found it rather hard to keep those hobbies alive. I mean, I go to the chess club (it's like sectioned off in a mall and feels extremely `sketch`, but the people are cool), but I haven't really `enjoyed` chess to the same extent I used to. Idk, it's weird. I liked OTB tournaments quite a lot (I've gone to two since coming to UT), and if anything, that's become more true. While I never really liked online chess, I would still find enjoyment in it and play to get better. However, I've found that instead of doing a chess puzzle when I have some downtime in a class or on a walk, I just read `Apple News`. It is very sad. I'm old now. Wtf. Might be time to pass the torch on. That's sad.

I came into UT Austin wanting to `double major` in Piano. After seeing the Interactive Degree Audit (showing me the needed classes), and realizing that about 0 classes overlap, piano requires 8 semesters of ensemble (I have 0 right now), and there are about 60 hours of theory classes, I have given up. I mean, I think the classes are possible in some `alternate` world, but the 8 semesters of ensemble already means I'd be graduating a semester `late`. I came into college wanting to graduate `early`. 
I've also finally found a good piano. I used to take the long walk to the Butler Hall of Music (which is about a 20 minute endeavor in 90 degree weather), but now I've discovered a Grand Piano right in the lobby of my dorm. I probably should've used that earlier. I'm smart. It's kinda a `scuffed` piano, but like it's also good. I sincerely want to make sure that I can perform the `4 Ballades` well. In my opinion, the 4 Ballades are the pinnacle of Chopin's writing (actually maybe not, but they're the best series), so I think being able to perform all 4 in one go would be really, really `cool`. Yep, just `cool`.

As for writing, it's always been kind of on and off, and I've had trouble sticking to a stable, daily regiment. At the same time though, I've always maintained some kind of practice. Though, for some reason, I've just had a hard time keeping that up in college. Luckily, there's a cool `LLC` (which is like kind of an org) that's about writing which does weekly things. That means, at the very least, I can somewhat keep up weekly stories of some sort.

The most surprising thing for me is that each of these three hobbies have not even dropped off in output due to less time. No, strangely, it's not that. I can't actually seem to pinpoint the exact reason, but my belief is that it's something to do with the `environment`. I've long held the belief that environment dictates a lot of `routine`, so perhaps, by moving to the dorm room as my main home instead of say my computer desk at home (I know very `sad` main home for both), I've lost some routine that kept up my hobbies. Rather interesting.

## Some ending thoughts as a time capsule

![stsdfs](/assets/postImages/Life1_6.png "time capsule")
`trust me, when i'm 89 on my deathbed, imma look at ts`

This stuff will be more `all-over-the-place` than anything else. 

Firstly, I think I came in wanting to do too many things. I got rejected from `Longhorn Developers` (like a UT organization for developing stuff), but at the same time, I'm not sure how fun nor how much time I'd be willing to `commit` to that. I have so many things I want to get good at -- like CAD, 3d printing stuff, robotics, math, proofs, business -- and at the end of the day, I think I'm very `stretched out`. This is also me just not wanting the `sour` grapes though (if you know that `allegory`).

I have some serious `math` commitments as part of a Directed Reading Program which has been very fun (mainly due to my great `mentor`). I also have some robotics stuff I want to do (and that I owe my `Combat Robotics` team to do). And then, I also just have this `subdueing` desire to start some business. Idk why though. Yeah, I've been kinda down from getting rejected from LHD. Perhaps, that was my mistake for only applying to a few `orgs`. Some other people I've talked to have told me that they applied to over `20`, and then I just think "wow, that's crazy".

Career fair was fun. I only handed out `4` resumes though. Everybody else handed out like 20. The people I talked to there were all super cool and nice (plus our conversations were fun). My lexicon has been gradually diminishing in complexity. Disappointing.

Also, `ChatGPT`` is something that I never go that deep into. I only really used it with friends. Recently though, I've found that it's very good at explaining certain concepts. I treat it as like a `TA` that can explain a mathematical proof or a simpler form of Google for documentation. Like, you can ask it to explain what a Hessian matrix represents or whether a Java data structure has a .contains method.  

I still waste too much time on `YouTube`. I have so many personal projects I also want to do. I'm stretched in too many directions. But like, at the same time, that's what I like!

## To conclude, I will conclude, by saying that in conclusion...

Shoot, I normally end these on a depressing note. Alright, I got this. I know how to end this on a depressing note.

I was thinking about the people I talked to in high school and realized that I will never see any of them who didn't go to UT Austin again. That's pretty depressing. 

There are also one friend I have that's out of state who I used to talk with a lot online (mainly talked in person before). Now, we've kinda stopped too.

Man, friendships suck. Too much `feeling`. I don't quite like it. But like, at the same time, it's gratifying to talk to people. Maybe, I just start talking to random people and use that to get my need for social interaction. There's no commitment that way.
