I have gone a `long(?)` time without success at a chess tournament. I mean, that definition is rather relative, but for me, I think I've gone about a full year without a truly successful tournament. I've had tournaments where I haven't been completely droven into the `ground`, but I haven't had any for at least a year where I've felt confident (and `good`) at chess. The last tournament where I had success was the 2024 Universal Chess Open U2000`(?)` where I got 2nd place (+ a lot of `money`!). Hans Niemann played at that tournament. I saw him. It was quite the experience.

>The fact that I am `alive` at this moment is a miracle, because after this first game I was ready to go the ocean and never come back!  
>I wanted to lose as quickly as possible, so I could go back to my hotel room, turn the lights off, order some delivery, watch `Netflix and numb the pain` until the next game. I think my Uber Eats has gone up to 1000 dollars for this event. I have been indulging and `numbing the pain` with 1000 dollar Uber Eats.  
>- Quote by one `Hans Niemann` (most chess player quote I've ever seen)

Either way, the point I wanted to make was that I was on some level of `tilt` for chess. I mean, I've never practiced or studied in any full capacity for chess, instead just kinda playing for fun, but it certainly does not feel good to `lose`. Actually, for like a month before this tournament, I was engaging in a lot of chess: playing `rapid` games, analyzing, and doing tons of chess `puzzles`. For me, chess is kinda a way to feel productive while waiting for something to happen or when I'm nervous. Idk. I played some chess right before graduation for some reasons. And I will leave it at that. Anyways, this was a `four game, one day` tournament (so pretty short in comparison to the three day or two day seven round tournaments).

I came into the first game realizing that I was playing against somebody who coached me for, I think, two weeks when I just got back into chess and was maybe `1100 USCF`. I was underrated though.

A rather sad game. Definitely could've been played better by me. The sad part is just how close I was to a perfect game. Move 24 (g4) is a huge mistake. Like, Jesus, just play Kh2. For some reason, I was in the `attack-attack-attack` mindset, so I ignored common sense. The craziest part is that I saw his ideas with `Qd5` and pinning my queen with his rook, but for some reason, I thought -- looks pretty `cool`, down to `try`.

I wanted to talk to my opponent after but, at the same time, felt kind of bad, so I did not do anything (`pro` extrovert).

Uh, quite a `sad` game. I think I was still somewhat on tilt the first two games. I played really poorly this game. Some absolutely abysmal follow ups to sacrifices and just no drive to fight for counterplay. Move 15 (a3) could've been replaced with d5 and I would've been `ding chilling`. Surprisingly, I still feel really great about this tournament even though I lost this game. I also think that's because my opponent was rated so far above me (2200 USCF) to the point where, even though I think I could've put up a `much better` fight, it's fine that I didn't. 

I also talked to this guy after the game. It was very fun talking to him. He's also like `CS adjacent` but at, I think, CMU (pretty smart guy). It's kinda sad to think how `difficult` chess will be to maintain in college though. Hopefully, I actually start practicing and studying to get better!

I'm just now realizing that by posting chess to my website, my opponents that `prep` are going to have a much easier time. Welp, hopefully I can just `outskill` them. Actually, the better idea might be getting so good at chess that I can play `any opening`! Yeah, that's not happening. I'm pretty washed and bad at chess.

This game was `decent` by me. Yeah, there were quite a few mistakes, but is what it is. I need to practice more chess. The opening was entirely new territory for me, but I should've just stuck to the `Sicilian Khan` setup. Immediately after playing Move 6 (Qb6), I realized a6 was so much `better`. a6 is a move in the Khan setup, should've just followed the limited opening theory I know.

Also, you have no idea how tempted I was to take on f2 with my Queen on Move 7. Yes, it's `completely losing`. But...idk man, looks cool or something? Still can't believe I missed the complexities in Bc5. I spent a long time looking at that move. But for some reason, I never fully explored Ne3.

I’m very happy, obviously — as happy as you can be beating a little kid.

Yeah, it's funnier when `Magnus` says it. Very nice game though. I liked my tactical prowess here. Also, I liked that one of my coach's ideas (a5) actually worked. I'd been telling him that a5 looked `stupid` (because it does) but it actually worked. Crazy. Some very nice Knight `jumps`, and I calculated basically to the `end` from Move 11.

I do feel bad about this game though. I am very sad and often tilt after losing chess games in that kinda way so I do hope my opponent gets over it quick.

`Very bad tiebreaks`

I am quite satisfied with my performance. I also grew 100 USCF points which is pretty damn good for just one tournament. Here is the lichess [study](https://lichess.org/study/zMyqTta6/lbKKtqQy) if you wanted to see it.

I unfortunately did not take any photos at this tournament. I feel like I am regretting more and more when I don't take `photos` at places in general. Perhaps part of getting older. Idk. I talked to a lot of cool people this tournament. Actually, that's a strange pattern for tournaments where I'm `successful`. Another strange pattern is succeeding at tournaments when I'm also getting over something in my life. Wait, that's actually true. That's `crazy`. This was a much shorter tournament than the 2024 Universal Open U2000, but the `patterns` are still the same. I'm also not sure if it's talking to other tournament players that makes me win games or if it's me winning games that makes me want to talk to other tournament players. `Strange`. 

Anyways, as is tradition, I will leave you with a nice little chess position.

`Not really all that tactical a position, but like it is a member of the set of all possible chess positions.`
