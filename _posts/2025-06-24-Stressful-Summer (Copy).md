In my last post, I started off with saying that spring semester of senior year was simultaneously the most `relaxing` time and the most `productive` time of my year (reading that in my head, I now realize that those are not `mutually exclusive`). Either way, I think I most felt that way due to the stress of the summer right before that. The simplest way to illustrate this is in the schedule I had during `July`. 

>I very much want to preface, though, by saying that, even though that summer was extremely `stressful`, I also would not have changed anything. 
>I learned and developed so many skills that I very much value now.

Anyways, during the weekdays on July, I had an internship that had me wake up at `7:30 AM` (frankly, not all that early considering when school starts) and getting home at `5:30 PM`. Don't get me wrong -- I am invariably grateful for the opportunities and learning experiences I had during that internship, but it was also the first `full` 9-5 (though really an `8-5`) that I'd worked with real responsibilities. Plus, I also did a lot of work on internship projects at home, which looking back (`hindsight bias`), was probably a major stressor. On Saturday, I'd wake up at `6:00 AM` and volunteer at St. David's Hospital until `3:00 PM`. Again, I want to make myself clear, these experiences were fantastic -- the people I met and the activities I partook(`?`) in were great! However, at the same time, it was the most `filled up` my schedule had ever been (beyond school, which, at a certain point, stops being stressful). After `3:00 PM`, I'd teach and manage a small chess club a friend and I started until about `5:00 PM` (again, the most fun I've perhaps had in a long time, but still very much the longest I've ever had to be `on`). 

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that perhaps it's not very interesting for me to explain why each of these events were great while `concurrently` 'complaining' about the stress they caused, but that was the reality I had. Between `7:00 PM` and `8:30` PM, I'd teach a private chess class. Sunday was a lot of chess. We had a chess club meeting some days as well as the afternoon consisting of chess classes. That being said, `Sunday` was the most relaxing day within those weeks. It would be the day I'd be waiting for -- mainly because I knew I'd have time to practice piano, read, and review the (very fun!) `math` that I was learning about at my internship. 

I tried to sprinkle those things in between the other times I had, but frankly, most days, I was way too tired to do anything other than just watch `YouTube`, or at best, go down some `Wikipedia rabbit hole`. Some weekends, I'd also go to competitions or tournaments as well, which was very interesting to `fit in`.

## Where I volunteered at St. David's

`I'm not one to really take pictures (kinda a regret now, my friend took some photos with me here), but I never really did`

Quite the stressful time looking back. But also, I kinda don't get how I was so stressed. Like, honestly, just `keep your head down and work like K does`. That was not as funny as I thought it would be! 

I mean, looking back, I gained a lot from being so stressed during summer. In fact, I think I probably could've grown more by being `more` stressed! The fact is that...what doesn't kill you makes you stronger...I'm sorry. No, but it's also kind of `true`! I think, being forced to pursue all those `different` things, have such `little` free time, and also get a `full` 8 hours each night (which I force myself to do), plus maintain my `prior` skills, develops something that can't be given by `genetics` or even `hard work`. 

I think a lot of life is based on `luck`, not talent or hard work. Surprisingly, who you're friends with is oftentimes just `chance`. I think I got `lucky` getting this experience right before senior year.

## My full schedule

`I don't really use calendars (for some reason, I think I'll get a better memory by just memorizing what I have to do)`

So much was learned. Mostly `R`, but also some other stuff. Yeah, I'm kinda running out of things to say. I somehow found time to do `activities` with friends like climbing and going to `places` (I do not know how). Anyways, I will leave you guys with a very nice chess position (plus, `main@benjamincai.com` works as an email now! (cloudflare was surprisingly easy, 17 year old me was `stupid`, nothing like 18 year old me who is very `smart`)).

`Look at ts. Beautiful. So goddamn beautiful. I feel bad for my opponent because I've been in his exact position. I hope he gets over it quick. Also Black to win in like 4 moves. Beautiful. Knights.`
