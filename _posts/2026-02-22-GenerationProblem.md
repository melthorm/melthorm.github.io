This will be a rather short post since I do need to complete it in about 30 minutes so I may sleep. Tomorrow will be along day as I have planned to finally take action to bring about goals. This past weekend was spent very similar to many before it, yet also distinctly more wasteful.

`Decisions, decisions, decisions`

To make a long story short, I have performed rather disappointedly on two very important examinations: my Real Analysis 1 test and my third Computer Architecture quiz. Frankly, I do not believe I was misprepared. Yes, I could've prepared better, but all the same, there have been past tests in which I have prepared less and came away thinking that I prepared more than enough. I am articulating my thoughts poorly, but my point is, I think I was as prepared as I have been for any and all past exams. That being said, it was clearly not enough.

Surprisingly, I think the cause of this is nerves. Thinking back, the real analysis questions were not too tough. Yes, I could've done more homework problems and been able to solve more of the proofs, but all things being said, I think it was nerves that got to me. As for computer architecture, I can say much of the same. The questions, looking back, were rather generic and (while not simple) absolutely doable. I think with less nerves and a lower BPM, I could've performed much better. 

Either way, those two quizzes are not the topic of today's post. Instead, it is to discuss the absolute moronic manner in which I squandered this current weekend. For context, I have a large Computer Architecture assignment I must start on, a Real Analysis problem set to finish, as well as a midterm tomorrow in Organic Chemistry which I feel I am not well prepared for. Of course, I have been somewhat neglecting organic chemistry and genetics in exchange for computer architecture and real analysis -- a decision which I still stand by. Even then though, I think I should be more prepared than I currently am. 

This weekend was spent entirely on YouTube. That is a rather sad fact. I have always thought myself free from addiction, though it may be time to face the truth. This seems rather waning. We shall see.

## To conclude, I will conclude, by saying that in conclusion...

Computer Architecture is still the most important class of this semester. I do not know if I will be able to earn an A in that class, though I do believe it is still possible. Either way, that class is less than trivial so I will need to put in far more effort. The biggest obstacle now, I believe, is test anxiety, which I believe is only remedied by taking many practice quizzes in the same environment under the same conditions. I will replicate that ideal for Real Analysis as well. After all, I would still like to have a 4.0 after this semester. We shall see how it goes.
