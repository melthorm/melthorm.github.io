    <h1>Stuff about me</h1>
    <p>High school senior at LASA in Austin, Texas. I know some programming languages (some). I also like writing just a tiny bit. Oh right, also chess and piano. I like those too. Chess is nice. Chess is very relaxing. Chess does not incite any anger from me. Piano is less nice. I'm currently learning Chopin's Ballade 4. It has a fun, short, simple little coda. <br> <br>Alright, now comes the point where I tell you my life story. I was born, popped out the place (yk the place). Then I grew older and bigger but none the wiser. As a kid, I thought I would want to be a surgeon when I grew up (now I don't know what I'm going to be), and now I'm here. <br><br>Now's the point where I talk a bit more about myself. I read a bunch of stuff. It is a bit disgusting how much I read. So I know a bunch of weird stuff. Idk how either. I spend my weekends at a chess club called Pawns to Prodigies an old friend and I made. It's pretty nice. A bunch of kids play at a bunch of boards and we walk around and try to just be inspiring (like those cool teachers). It most of the time does not work. <br><br>If you need to reach me, my email is <a href="mailto:bencai1@outlook.com">here</a> (promise it's not a virus).</p>
