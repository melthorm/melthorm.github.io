    <h1>Stuff about me</h1>
    <p>I started coding cause it was cool. I don't know. Hard to say. I'm currently a high school senior at LASA in Austin, Texas. I know a couple programming languages, I think. I also like writing somewhat. Oh right, also chess and piano. I like those too. Chess is nice. Chess is a very relaxing sport that does not incite any anger. It is very, very relaxing. I'm learning Chopin's Ballade 4 right now. It has a fun, short, simple little coda. <br> <br> Cool. See you later. Goodbye!</p>
