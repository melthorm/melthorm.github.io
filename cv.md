# Curriculum Vit√¶

{% include contact.html %}

## Uh

I got a latex resume somewhere, lemme find it rq.

<a href="/assets/files/2_Page_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Found it!</a>

Word of warning, I have not updated it in some time, and it was also used for, I think, jobs, idk, doesn't have much other stuff on it. So, uh, I will do what is absolutely necessary for the well-being of this site and add a more `extended` resume, focused on no job stuff, down here.

## Programming
I made some cool projects like <a href="/webProjects/chessHangman/index.html" target="_blank">Chess Hangman</a> (warning: it's very zoomed in). I also learned a lot about a lot of different fields, mostly phylogenetics (here's a <a href="/assets/files/ViralSim_Report.pdf" target="_blank">summary (LaTeX report)</a> and a <a href="/assets/files/BenjaminCai_Oden_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">presentation (LaTeX Beamer)</a> I gave at the Oden Institute for one of the projects that I've worked on in phylogenetics, ViralSim). I did a lot of other stuff (most of which is not actually on GitHub but instead on <a href="https://codeberg.org/melthorm" target="_blank">Codeberg</a>. A lot of `math` was learned through programming... or maybe it was the other way around. Yeah, it was probably the other way around.

## Piano
I've been playing for a pretty long time (can't really remember though). I probably got serious about piano during quarantine and practiced the most freshman and sophomore year of high school. Like, at its peak, probably an hour on weekdays and `God-knows-how-long-on-weekends`. I quite like the piano and would like to continue playing. My current repertoire (as of 6/24/2025) has Ballade 1, Ballade 4, Heroic Polonaise, Waldstein 3rd Movement, Fantasia in C Minor (hopefully Fugue too), and (probably) 1st movement of Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto 1 (though I'd have to look at that concerto again). Here's my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BenjaminCai" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, where I might post more piano again.

Oh, also, I just want to mention that Moszkowski 1 is a very nice piece (especially the second movement which I never played in a real capacity). Search it up, and at least listen to the full second movement!

## Chess
I'm pretty bad at chess man. It's quite sad. I used to...actually, I think I'm at my peak rn. Either way, I should probably practice chess more. Yk, my coach once said, a chess player is like a `shark`. Sharks need to constantly swim to `breathe/survive`. Chess players need to constantly practice to `breathe/survive` too. I don't practice. That's probably bad.

Most tournaments I've played in are in my public studies at my <a href="https://lichess.org/@/TurboCompass" target="_blank">lichess account</a>.

## Creative Writing
Too personal, sorry man, but like most things I do, it could do with more practice.
