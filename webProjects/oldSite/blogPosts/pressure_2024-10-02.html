    <h1>pressure</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-10-02</p>
    <p>You ever feel like everybody else but you is moving forward? Like there's pressure to do so much because everybody around you is doing so much. And then, there's that sinking feeling when you realize that it is so much, so much work. It's strange. <br><br>People have been talking about 'locking in' now that it's college application season. But strangely, I don't think I can. I think it's been too long where I just haven't committed, tried, or thought too hard, and now it's too difficult. I don't know. It's hard to keep my mind glued to one thing. <br><br>Either way though, that focus is all that matters in life... which is a bit comforting. Since what that means is that anybody can start 'locking in' at any point and catch up to others. At least, that's how I've seen life. At any moment, someone can begin putting in effort to 'catch up'. <br><br>But should the goal even be to 'catch up'? Like, catching up is such a weird goal to have. I feel like my goal shouldn't be to catch up but to find something else to pull away with. <br><br>Man, life is strange. Cya later.</p>
