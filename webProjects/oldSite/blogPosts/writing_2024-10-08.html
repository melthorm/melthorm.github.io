    <h1>writing</h1>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 2024-10-08</p>
    <p>I'm gonna be honest rq. Writing college essays seems a lot harder than it is. I knocked out like 90% of the college essays I needed to write in about 2 hours during my English class today (that was only because teacher wasn't here). And also, the essays were stupidly easy to write. From the surface, it seems so difficult, but once you sit down and write, stuff just flows out. Of course, there's still difficulty in deciding what parts to highlight. <br><br>I am applying CS so I hope my resume is good enough. I also just started thinking of CS recently so my resume kinda sucks and is front-loaded with Summer and Fall senior CS stuff. Hopefully, that demonstrates enough of an interest. I can't wait until college applications are over and I can solely focus on some of the bigger projects I want to create. Those projects seem really cool (and need a lot more work) like transmission cluster/phylogeny stuff but college anxiety has just been dragging me down. <br><br>I feel like the biggest problem with schoolwork and college and anything with deadlines is the stress. None of the work is actually difficult. None of the work will take long to complete. It's just that it weighs on your brain and stops you from relaxing or getting anything else fun done. I know this because for a while I stopped practicing piano because I was petrified from thinking about summer programs and school stuff. The only solution is to just blindly focus on the thing that's stressing you out to get it out of the way. Luckily, most of the time that is not difficult.</p>
