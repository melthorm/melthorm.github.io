I played this game during COVID called diep.io a lot. It was nice. I made a lot of friends on there. Writing this now, it sounds extremely sad, but it was fun back then. <br><br>The problem comes when you and those friends inevitably separate. I think I'm just now realizing that it's near impossible to stay friends with someone without seeing them in person often. Because now, now that COVID has ended for a pretty long time and diep has fallen off and there's no more need to rely on online friends to stay sane, we stopped talking. Those friends and I simply grew apart. And that thought is sad. <br><br>What's more sad though is the realization that the same will happen for high school. And college. And work. Over and over again. <br><br>Some might use the phrase 'keeping in touch' as an excuse but at the end of the day, the extent of 'keeping in touch' is a light question like 'how's your life been' or 'happy birthday'. None of it is real. But, that's life. Cya later.
