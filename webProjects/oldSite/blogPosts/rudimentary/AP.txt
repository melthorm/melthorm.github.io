Don't we love Collegeboard? Fantastic. Utterly fantastic. <br> <br>Collegeboard is a nonprofit, did you know that? Collegeboard does not make any profit. <br><br>I'm self studying 5 APs this year. I myself do not know why. I think I just learn better when there's a test awaiting. It is very strange. <br><br>The more I think about that, the more I disagree. In my linear algebra class, that was very much not true. I learned way more during times where there wasn't a looming test. <br><br>I mean, my only past experience with self study (which inspired me to sign up for 5 more APs was in sophomore year when I self studied AP Bio. That was very fun. I am not joking. Very, very fun. This is actually not sarcasm. <br> <br>Right, but that's why I chose to self study 5 more APs and pay the nonprofit Collegeboard maybe 300 more dollars. I will definitely learn a lot...like a week before the exam. It will be fun. I think the exam I'm most looking forward to is AP Spanish since I have not spoken or practiced Spanish in about 3 years. It will be fine. Es bien. Si. I do not have accents on this computer. <br><br>Apart from that, I'm self studying the Chem, Stats, and two Physics tests. Highly recommend to others. <br><br>Alright, cool. Cya later.
